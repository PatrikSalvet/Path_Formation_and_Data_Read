## 1. Project Overview
This project provides a set of Python utilities designed to format, filter, and simplify the creation of file paths and data loading process. It includes a robust function for generating a formated list of absolute file paths with many features, such as searching for all files with a specified format in a folder. It then stores the results in a variable which can be dirrectly passed into pandas.read function. It suppports xlsx, txt or even csv formats. It also includes a GUI wrapper which significantly simplifies and further speeds up the process. The function returns a detailed log which allows the user to check and spot any potential misstakes. Additionally another compatible function using pandas library to load the content of the stored variables is currently in progress and can be located in the package directory together with all the other functions.
